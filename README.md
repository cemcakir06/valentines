# Nergis Valentine Game

A playful, interactive Valentine's Day page for Nergis — featuring Cem, Bıdık, and a whole lot of charm.

## How it works

Open `index.html` (or `will-you-be-my-valentine.html`, which redirects) and try to say NO. Spoiler: it gets harder every time.

## Deploy on GitHub Pages

1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. Go to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch** → pick `main` / `/ (root)` → **Save**.
4. Your site will be live at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/` within a minute or two.

## Image filenames

GitHub Pages is **case-sensitive**. All images in this repo use **lowercase** extensions (`.png`). If you add new images, keep them lowercase to avoid 404s.

## Credits

Made with love by Cem, co-signed by Bıdık (a.k.a. Bıdıkko, Bobalak, Babukko, Dobalak).
